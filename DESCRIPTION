Description: A collection of wrapper functions that allow you to easily make
    statistical charts in ggplot2. Specifically, it supports the following
    types of plots: boxplot, barplot, lineplot, histogram, density plot, and
    scatter plot. It also allows you to easily resize and rotate the axis
    tick text, adjust the distances between the axises labels and the axises.
    It frees you from knowing the details of ggplot2 commands.
