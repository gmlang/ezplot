Description: A collection of wrapper functions that allow you to easily make
    statistical charts in ggplot2. It also allows you to easily resize and rotate 
    the axis tick text, adjust the distances between the axises labels and the 
    axises. It frees you from knowing the details of ggplot2 commands.
