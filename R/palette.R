#' The default colors in ggplot2 can be difficult to distinguish from one another 
#' because they have equal luminance. They are also not friendly for colorblind 
#' viewers. A good general-purpose solution is to just use the 
#' colorblind-friendly palette below taken directly from 
#' http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/
#' 
#' cbPalette is the palette with gray, and cbbPalette is with black.
