\title{Estimate the rate of the exponential distribution from which the
sample data were taken.}
\usage{
est_params_expdist(df, varname, digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame.}

\item{varname.}{String, name of a continuous variable with an empirical
distribution approximately exponential.}

\item{digits.}{Integer, the number of digits after decimal point to keep for
the estimated parameter values.}
}
\value{
An estimate of the rate of a theoretical exponential distribution.
}
\description{
Given a data frame and the name of a continuous variable from the data frame,
suppose the CCDF of the variable on a log-y scale is linear, then its
distribution can be modeled by the exponential distribution, of which the
rate can be estimated by this function.
